## Abmormal Heartbeat Detector using ECG signal
A deep learning project using PyTorch to detect abnormal heartbeat from electrocardiogram signal

### Overview:
- Built a neural network using 1-dimensional convolution and Residual Network (ResNet) blocks
- Defined customized dataloader to balance outcome classes in training data
- Trained the model for 100 epochs, with 10% data for validation
- Achieved accuracy > 0.99 and f1-score > 0.99 for both outcome classes in testing data
